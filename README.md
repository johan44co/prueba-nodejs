# Test NodeJS Express and SQL Server

This porject use SQL Servers, and NodeJS Express to build a API
the documentation of this API can be found on https://test-nodejs.netlify.app/ also the SQL query required for create and feed the database are under the folder SQLScripts. The API handled errors and validate the information given by the cunsumer.

It was fun to use SQL Server as DB, personally I like to use NoSQL DB like MongoDB, but I can not hide that is really pleasent to use SQL query to make changes on tables and fecth the data as well.

I enjoyed creating main asynchronous JavaScript funtions, this always make JavaScript more facinating now days.

Finally I test my API using Insomnia https://insomnia.rest/ an amazing API client, that I highly recommend to give it a try, together with insomnia-documenter package/module you can have top-notch documentation in seconds https://github.com/jozsefsallai/insomnia-documenter
